# Omni-Gnome Chess Engine

Omni-Gnome is a UCI-compatible chess engine with an estimated rating of 1325. Omni-Gnome is quite minimalist, the bitboard representation and pseudo-legal move generator form the backbone of the engine, while an alpha-beta search routine, enhanced by interal iterative deeping, and an evaluation based on material and mobility handle move selection.

The engine requires a GUI such as Xboard to play, and runs of Unix systems.
