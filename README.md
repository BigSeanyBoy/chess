# Omni-Gnome Chess Engine

Omni-Gnome is a UCI-compatible chess engine with an estimated rating of 1325. A bitboard representation and pseudo-legal move generator form the backbone of the engine. Search is conducted via an alpha-beta search routine, enhanced by internal iterative deepening and quiescence. Positional evaluation is scored based on material, pawn structure, and mobility.

The engine requires a GUI such as Xboard to play and runs on Unix systems.
